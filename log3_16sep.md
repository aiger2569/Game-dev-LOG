# Indie Dev Log 3 – Daily Entry

## 16 Sept 2025

There is an orientation on **19 Sept 2025** with the campus GFG personnel.  
Some big names and connections will be there.  

My plan before the event:  
- Prepare a few questions to ask, so I don’t just sit quietly.  
- Think about how to explain my goals (game dev, small projects, and learning path) in simple words.  
- Keep an open mind and look for someone who might be interested in mentoring me.

### Reflection
I don’t know what will come out of this, but showing up matters.  
If I can even make one good connection, it could mean guidance I don’t have right now.  
For now, I’ll just get ready, keep it real, and not overthink.
