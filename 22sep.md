# Indie Dev Log 4 – Daily Entry

## 22 Sept 2025

Today I started looking into **3D models and rendering**.  
It’s my first step into figuring out how characters and objects actually take shape on screen.  

Plans from here:  
- Learn some **basic actions and animations** to get a feel for movement.  
- Try making something small that actually runs without breaking my laptop.  
- Maybe set up a few **side projects** I can post on GitHub (and if they look decent, share on LinkedIn too).

### Reflection
It feels like a big area, but I want to take it slow.  
Even simple animations can teach me a lot about how games come alive.  
If I can start putting small projects online, it’ll be proof that I’m moving forward.  
Step by step, one build at a time.
