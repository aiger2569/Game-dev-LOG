# Indie Dev Log – Struggles of a Broke College Student

This is my diary of hardships while trying to learn **game development** with very limited resources.  
Basically, me vs. my laptop in a deathmatch. Spoiler: the laptop is winning… for now.

## September 2025

### Hardware Limitations
- **Low-budget PC:**  
  - Unity/Unreal takes **15 minutes** to open the 3D environment. By the time it loads, I’ve already lost the will to live.  
  - GPU upgrade?  have better luck robbing a bank than affording one.  
- **Thermal Throttling / Overheating:**  
  - After 30–40 minutes of testing, my laptop turns into a tandoor oven.  
  - Every build feels like Russian roulette: will it compile, or will it *self-immolate*?  
  - Solution so far: work in 20-min sprints and pray my cooling fan doesn’t take off like a drone.  

### Development Roadblocks
- **Scope vs. Hardware:**  
  - My imagination: *“Open world RPG with dynamic weather!”*  
  - My laptop: *“How about a pixel-art Pong clone instead, champ?”*  
- **Bug Swarms:**  
  - Fix one bug → three new ones spawn, like cursed hydras.  
  - At this point, I don’t debug — I just negotiate truces with the code.  

### Financial Struggles
- Can’t afford assets, premium tools, or even a proper cooling pad.  
- Living off free trials like a raccoon living off leftover pizza.  
- Found a “miracle cooling fan” on **M***ho for ₹200** — pretty sure it doubles as a table fan, but hey, innovation.

## Reflections
- **Optimize or die:** My broke setup forces me to squeeze every ounce of performance out of assets.  
- **Small > Big:** Better a finished tiny project than another corpse in my folder of *“Games That Could’ve Been.”*  
- **Suffering = Skill:** Apparently poverty is the best teacher. Thanks, life.  T-T

## Next Steps
- Explore lightweight engines (*Godot, I’m looking at you like you’re my last hope*).  
- Write cleaner code so bugs don’t spread like STDs. [dont ban me github] 
- Release small indie games — even if no one plays them, at least I’ll have receipts for my suffering.  
- Try the ₹200 cooling hack before my laptop turns into ashes and voids its own warranty.

**Note to self:**  
It’s not about owning the best PC.  
It’s about proving you can ship a game on a dying toaster, fueled only by caffeine, stubbornness, and a questionable sense of humor.  
(…but also, seriously, get a job and save for a new rig before this one *literally explodes*.)
