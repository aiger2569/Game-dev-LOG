# Indie Dev Log 2 – Future Plans[yes 2 logs in a single day, it is more of a planner though]

This file is for the games and projects I plan to build next.  
No big dreams here, just simple goals I can work on with the tools I have.

---

## Chess Engine
- I want to build a basic chess engine.  
- Main target: it should at least play a legal game and maybe beat me sometimes.  
- Start with simple rules: piece moves, board state, and basic evaluation.  
- Later I can try minimax or alpha-beta pruning if my laptop can handle it.  
- If I get time, I’ll try to add a small UI for it.

## Small Games (End Goals)
These are small projects I can actually finish:  
- **Snake** – easy to start, fun to play.  
- **Tetris** – block dropping logic, nothing too fancy.  
- **Breakout** – ball, paddle, and bricks.  
- **Text Adventure / Simple Roguelike** – all logic, no graphics, perfect for my PC.

## Experiments
- Try pathfinding algorithms like A* or Dijkstra in small grids.  
- Learn basic procedural generation (maps, levels, or item drops).  
- Keep code and notes clean so I don’t confuse myself later.

## Plan
1. Start with the chess engine basics.  
2. Pick one small game (maybe Snake) and finish it fully.  
3. Slowly move to the other games.  
4. Keep logging progress and problems.

**Note to self:**  
Don’t rush.  
Finish one thing at a time.  
Even a small working game is better than ten unfinished ideas.
