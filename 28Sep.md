# 🎮 Game Development Log – [Date: 28/09/2025]

## ⚡ Reflections on Corporate Practices
Today, I spent some time thinking about how **large corporations** influence the workspace environment and the creative freedom of indie and junior developers.  

It’s kind of wild — while big studios can provide structure, resources, and exposure, the **rigid hierarchies and strict guidelines** often **stifle creativity**.  
For indie devs like me, it’s a balancing act: having the freedom to experiment, iterate, and fail fast, while still maintaining some structure for progress.  

I’m realizing more and more that working independently allows me to **own my creative process**, even if it comes with the challenge of limited resources.

## 😂 Funny Blender Incident
While experimenting with Blender for concept art and 3D models, I managed to **accidentally set the resolution ridiculously high** — I’m talking *“is my laptop about to explode?”* level.  

Before I could fix it… I **logged out of my session**. 😅  
Lesson learned: always **double-check render settings** before hitting anything that might lock your system.

## 🔜 Next Steps
- Continue exploring **Blender basics** for modeling and texturing.  
- Experiment with **small prototypes** to simulate open-world elements.  
- Document all mistakes and learnings — they make great stories for the dev journey.  

> Even errors like blowing up your screen resolution are just part of the learning process!
